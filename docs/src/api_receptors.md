Here we present the documentation of our receptor library. These receptors can act as the postsynaptic receptors in a neuron to neuron connection, when connecting neurons of appropriate types, e.g. an inhibitory projection works with a GABAergic receptor and a dopamine receptor requires that the presynaptic neuron is dopaminergic.
